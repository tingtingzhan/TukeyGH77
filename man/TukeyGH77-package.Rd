\title{Tukey \eqn{g}-&-\eqn{h} Distribution}
\value{
Returned values of individual functions are documented separately.
}
\description{
Density, cumulative density, quantile and simulation of
the 4-parameter Tukey (1977) \eqn{g}-&-\eqn{h} distributions.
The quantile-based transformation (Hoaglin 1985)
and its reverse transformation,
as well as the letter-value based estimates (Hoaglin 1985),
are also provided.
